					<h3>Greater Margins.</h3>
					<p>Replacing expensive rotors, stators and bearing packs frequently will erode your margins. To maintain or increase margins, you need to reduce maintenance costs. The M3 will do just that. It utilizes all the latest materials in a smaller, less complex package that helps keep costs down.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="heading">
					<h3>Less to Maintain</h3>
					<p>The M3 has built-in safety systems that prevent premature wear and help eliminate problems downhole. What’s more, all the M3 parts are made of anti-corrosive materials that make clean-up and redress a snap.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="heading">
					<h3>Less Inventory</h3>
					<p>The M3’s compact size means inventory takes up less space.  It’s easier to handle and transport than older motors. And, because one motor does the job of many, you have less inventory to stock overall.</p>
					<p>With the new M3 there are no downsides. Just more down hole performance and value.</p>
